/*1. What is JSX and why do we use it in React?
Ans: JSX stands for javascript xml file it help us to  write javascript logic 
along with html for creating ui components
*/

/*2. Explain the difference between a **component** and an **element** in React.
Component is just like a js function which  sindependent a reusable entity.
element consist of start tag ,end tag along with content 
*/

/*3. What are **props** in React? Are they mutable or immutable?
props are properties that a parent component send to child component in order to 
send data props are immutable.
*/

/*4. What is the main difference between **state** and **props**?
state -  state is a hook it help us to maintain state of an element at any event
props- help us to send data from parent to child component
*/

/*5. How do you update state in a React component?
WE use UseState hook it return us a variable which contains the current value and a 
setter function which upades the state
*/

/*6. What is the significance of using **keys** in lists?
keys in list help us in index and to perform operation son specific index
*/

/*7. Explain **conditional rendering** with an example.
conditional rendering - in order to render the UI componet based on certian conditions
we use conditional rendering with the help of if -else, switch,ternart operator
let value=true;
(value)?(task1):(task2);
*/

/*8. Why do we use **arrow functions** in event handlers? 
because they provide us an event object which contains various properties
like event.target.value ,event.target etc
*/

/*9. What is the role of the `return` statement inside a functional component? 
return() - return satement inside any functional component basically renders 
everthing to the ui where that component is imported and called.
everthing inside return() ->appears on the UI
*/

/*10. Write the syntax for passing and receiving props in a functional component.
passing props : <Card user="name"/>

receiveing   :   function Card(user)
{
return()
}
